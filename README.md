# Modal Logic in Lean 4

A comprehensive formalization of normal modal propositional logic in [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/) with [Mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/), featuring **soundness and completeness proofs for all 16 normal modal logics** in the modal cube, the **finite model property**, and **decidability**.

**~12,800 lines of Lean · 0 sorry's · Only standard axioms (propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound)**

## Highlights

- **Soundness and completeness** for all **16 distinct** normal modal logics obtainable from subsets of {T, B, 4, D, 5}:
  K, KT, KB, K4, K5, KD, KTB, S4, KB4, KDB, KD4, KD5, K45, KB5, KD45, S5
- **Finite model property** via filtration for **all 16** logics: K, T, KD, KB, S5, K4, S4, KD4, KTB, KDB, KB4, KB5, K5, KD5, K45, and KD45
- **Decidability** of **all 16** logics as `DecidablePred` instances
- **Frame correspondence**: T ↔ Reflexive, B ↔ Symmetric, 4 ↔ Transitive, 5 ↔ Euclidean, D ↔ Serial
- **Undefinability** of irreflexivity
- **Craig interpolation** for modal logic K (fully proved)
- **Beth definability** theorem (fully proved)
- **Universe-polymorphic semantics**: forcing (`forces`) and validity (`fValid`, `FValid`) work over frames in any universe
- **Local vs. global consequence** with concrete counterexamples
- **Full axiom audit** via `#print axioms` on every major theorem

## The Modal Cube

The project systematically covers every normal modal logic formed by combining five axiom schemas:

| Axiom | Schema | Frame Condition |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **T** | □φ → φ | Reflexivity |
| **B** | φ → □◇φ | Symmetry |
| **4** | □φ → □□φ | Transitivity |
| **D** | □φ → ◇φ | Seriality |
| **5** | ◇φ → □◇φ | Euclidean |

While 2⁵ = 32 subsets are possible, key collapse results (e.g., T implies D; T + 5 yields equivalence) reduce them to exactly **16 distinct logics**, all of which are formalized with full soundness and completeness.

       S4    KTB   KB4
        \     |     /
         KT  KB   K4
          \  |  /
            K         ... + D and 5 extensions

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/setup.html) (v4.28.0 or compatible)
- Mathlib4 (fetched automatically by Lake)

### Build

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd modal-logic-lean4
lake build
```

### Usage

```lean
import ModalLogic

open Modal

-- Define propositional variables
def p := Form.var 0
def q := Form.var 1

-- Prove theorems in K
example : ∅ ⊢K (p ⊃ p) := ProofK.identity
example : ∅ ⊢K (□(p ⊃ q) ⊃ (□p ⊃ □q)) := ProofK.kdist

-- Use necessitation
example (h : ∅ ⊢K p) : ∅ ⊢K □p := ProofK.nec h
```

## Craig Interpolation

The project includes a complete proof of **Craig interpolation** for modal logic K:

> If `⊢K φ ⊃ ψ`, then there exists an interpolant `θ` with
> `vars θ ⊆ vars φ ∩ vars ψ`, `⊢K φ ⊃ θ`, and `⊢K θ ⊃ ψ`.

The proof architecture includes:
- **V-bisimulation theory**: a bisimulation notion parameterized by variable set V
- **Product model construction**: combining two V-bisimilar models into one
- **Syntactic Craig interpolation**: the core theorem proved via the canonical model method
- **Semantic interpolation**: derived from the syntactic version via soundness + completeness
- **Craig interpolation theorem**: the standard formulation
- **Beth definability**: implicit definability implies explicit definability (fully proved)

## Proof Technique

Completeness is established via the **canonical model method**:

1. Assume a formula φ is not provable (⊬ φ)
2. Show {¬φ} is consistent
3. Extend to a maximal consistent set via **Lindenbaum's lemma** (using Zorn's lemma)
4. Construct the **canonical model** where worlds are maximal consistent sets
5. Prove the **truth lemma**: w ⊩ ψ iff ψ ∈ w
6. Obtain a countermodel, so φ is not valid (⊭ φ)

For logics beyond K, the canonical model's accessibility relation is shown to satisfy the required frame conditions (reflexivity, transitivity, etc.).

## Related Work

Several formalizations of modal logic have been carried out in other proof assistants.
This project distinguishes itself by covering **all 16 normal modal logics** in the
modal cube with full soundness and completeness, together with the finite model
property and decidability.

- **Bentzen** formalizes a Hilbert-style proof system for K and S5 in Lean 4,
  with soundness and completeness via canonical models. Our project extends this
  approach to all 16 logics and adds the finite model property and decidability.

- **From** (Isabelle, Archive of Formal Proofs) provides completeness proofs for
  K, KT, S4, and S5 using a synthetic completeness method. Our work covers
  12 additional logics (including the D and 5 families) and provides a unified
  canonical model framework.

- **Doczkal & Smolka** formalize constructive completeness and decidability for
  the modal μ-calculus fragment K* (PDL without iteration) in Coq. Their approach
  emphasizes constructive methods and proof-theoretic decidability, complementing
  our classical canonical model approach.

- **Blanchette et al.** develop formalizations of various logics in Isabelle,
  including some modal fragments, as part of broader formalization efforts.
